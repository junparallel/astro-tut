# My First Blog Post
Published on: 2024-11-20

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will be learning in public. 
## What I have accomplished 
1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! 

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts.
